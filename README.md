# Calendar application.

### In this project was developed the React app for rendering the Calendar with displaying each day of the month with available events on it. There are some features on top menu to navigate with exact date and select timezones. You can also see the created events (tasks) in separate day of the month and select for more details view. By clicking the event, the modal (pop-up) window opens with neceserry data inside, considering the new or past event.

## In this project I used React JS with hooks:
- `useState()`
- `useEffect()`
